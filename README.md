# transaction_simulation
An application to perform an analysis of inventory for a small wholesale food products company.

## Building
-----------
To build our application simply invoke `make`. This will create an object file `a.out` that executes the main entry point found in the `main_application.cpp` source file. The `-l` flag is needed so that g++ knows to link
with the boost library found in the includes folder.

## Design Model
Please see our [DESIGN_DOC](DESIGN_DOC.md) for more information on our class model.
