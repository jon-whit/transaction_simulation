FoodItems:

Warehouses:
Each warehouse in a company is identified via the name of the city (string) where the warehouse
is located. A map datastructure would be a great way to stores these associations.

 warehouse name | *Warehouse
 ---------------------------
 "Columbus"     | ->Warehouse("Columbus")
 "Scottsdale"   | ->Warehouse("Scottsdale")
 "Tacoma"       | ->Warehouse("Tacoma")

Each key in the map could be a pointer to a Warehouse object. Each Warehouse object
will store its location and an inventory of FoodItem objects. A Warehouse object
must be able to add food items and remove food items from its inventory.
